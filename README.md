This Flashcards Study App is a simple yet powerful learning tool designed to help students, teachers, and lifelong learners review concepts efficiently. Built entirely with Python and Tkinter (Pythonâ€™s built-in GUI toolkit), the app offers an intuitive and distraction-free study experience.

âœ¨ Key Features:
	â€¢	Easy-to-use interface â€“ clean and responsive design, perfect for quick study sessions.
	â€¢	Create & Save Custom Flashcards â€“ add your own questions and answers for any subject.
	â€¢	Instant Review Mode â€“ click to reveal answers and test your recall instantly.
	â€¢	Persistent Storage â€“ your flashcards are saved locally so you can return anytime without losing progress.
	â€¢	Lightweight & Portable â€“ runs on any device with Python installed, no heavy dependencies.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
This project was built to make self-paced learning more interactive and organized. Whether youâ€™re preparing for school exams, learning a new language, or reviewing important facts, this app helps you stay consistent and focused.

ðŸ’¡ Why This App Stands Out:
Unlike generic note-taking tools, the Flashcards Study App is focused purely on active recall, which is scientifically proven to strengthen memory retention. Its minimal design ensures learners can focus on content instead of distractions
